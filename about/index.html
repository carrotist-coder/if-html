    <p>
      Hi there! <br />I'm Markovsky Dmitry, and recently
      <strong>I've started learning Frontend development</strong>&#128526;
    </p>
    <p>I've chosen Frontend for several reasons.</p>
    <p>
      At first, I had already engaged in programming before, started from
      Scratch<sup>1</sup> when I was ten years old, then turned to Python and
      C++.<br />
      I decided to try something new, analyzed all the fields in IT sphere and
      finally took up Frontend.<br />
      From my point of view, Frontend is the most spectacular of all IT spheres,
      which allows you to create massive web pages and applications on the
      Net.<br />
      I'd say for now this is the closest direction to me, and I'm ready to
      learn it&#128522;

    <h3>My strong developer qualities</h3>
    <p>
      As I said before, I studied Python, C++. Moreover, I'm familiar with
      Git.<br />
      I participated in different programming olympics such as ICPC, which has
      developed my teamwork skills.<br />
      Also I have a high English level (B1-B2).<br />
      At last I'm a creative person and always generate ideas to solve
      problems&#128161;
